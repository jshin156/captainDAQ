have Doxygen installed.
for mac: sudo ln -s /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen /usr/local/bin

I can't help but tell you that you need QT creator or like. to edit config3 because you need
the full path to your directory that you want documented and the output directory.  

or if you want to just create one yourself do:

doxygen -g config3
Make sure that EXTRACT_ALL is a YES.
