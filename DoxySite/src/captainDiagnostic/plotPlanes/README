Synopsis:
plotPlanes [dat_directory] [first_run last_run log_file]



Description:
plotPlanes takes in a plaintext run log and binry Nevis dat files and outputs a ROOT file
plotting voltage as a function of time and wire index for each plane and collection index.



Expected log file format:

runNumber; lineDriverPortNumber1, lineDriverPortNumber2, ... # comment
# comment



Notes:
Makefile assumes a root installation at "/usr/local/root". Modify as necessary.



Known bugs:

|sample| > 20000 and sample == 0 are symptoms of soft errors in the dat files,
cause to be determined.
These samples are currently set to zero.
Zero-valued samples are ignored in mean and RMS calculations.

The range of runs being processed must be contiguous, and there can be no runs before
the first run to be processed in the log file. This will be fixed in the next few days.
